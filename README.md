# LiverDiseaseDetection

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to use classification algorithms to detect the liver patients from healthy individuals. In this study, THREE classification algorithms Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been considered for comparing their performance based on the liver patient data. Further, the model with the highest accuracy is implemented as a user-friendly GUI using the flask in python. The GUI can be easily utilized by doctors and medical practitioners as a screening tool for liver disease.

## Dataset
The dataset used is The Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD) which was selected from UCI Machine learning repository for this study. The data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The "Dataset" column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patients (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.

## Conclusion
In this project, we have proposed methods for diagnosing liver disease in patients using machine learning techniques. The different machine learning techniques that were used include Logistic Regression, KNN, Support vector Machine, Gaussian Naive bayes, Random forest and XGB classifier. The system was implemented using all the models and their performance was evaluated. Performance evaluation was based on model accuracy. Random forest was the model that resulted in the highest accuracy. A GUI is developed using Flask and implemented using Random forest. The system will predict whether the patient has liver disease or not based on the trained model. The GUI will be a useful tool for medical staff in the early detection of liver disease in patients
